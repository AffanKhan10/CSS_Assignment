    <h2>
      1. What are the main differences between external, internal, and inline
      CSS?
    </h2>
    <p>
      External CSS is defined in a separate file and linked to the HTML
      document, while internal CSS is defined within the head section of the
      HTML document. Inline CSS is defined within a specific HTML tag using the
      style attribute. External CSS is more efficient for styling larger
      websites as it allows for greater consistency and easier maintenance,
      while internal and inline CSS are more suitable for smaller projects or
      individual tags.
    </p>

    <h2>2. What is the syntax for class and ID selectors?</h2>
    <p>
      The syntax for a class selector is a period followed by the class name,
      e.g. .classname. The syntax for an ID selector is a pound sign followed by
      the ID name, e.g. #idname.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How would you apply a single rule to two different selectors?</h2>
    <p>
      You can separate the selectors with a comma, e.g. selector1, selector2 {
      rule: value; }
    </p>

    <h2>
      4. Given an element that has an id of title and a class of primary, how
      would you use both attributes for a single rule?
    </h2>
    <p>#title.primary { rule: value; }</p>

    <h2>5. What does the descendant combinator do?</h2>
    <p>
      The descendant combinator, represented by a space between selectors,
      selects elements that are descendants of another element. For example,
      "parent selector descendant selector" selects all descendants of the
      parent selector.
    </p>

    <h2>
      6. Between a rule that uses one class selector and a rule that uses three
      type selectors, which rule has the higher specificity?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The rule that uses the class selector has higher specificity than the rule
      that uses three type selectors.
    </p>

    <h2>
      7. From inside to outside, what is the order of box-model properties?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The order of box-model properties from inside to outside is padding,
      border, margin.
    </p>

    <h2>8. What does the box-sizing CSS property do?</h2>
    <p>
      The box-sizing property determines how the width and height of an element
      is calculated. The default value is content-box, which only includes the
      content area in the width and height calculation. The border-box value
      includes the padding and border in the calculation, resulting in a box
      with a fixed size.
    </p>

    <h2>
      9. What is the difference between the standard and alternative box model?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The standard box model calculates the width and height of an element based
      on the content box, padding, border, and margin. The alternative box
      model, using the box-sizing property with a value of border-box,
      calculates the width and height of an element based on the content box and
      padding, but includes the border and margin in the overall size of the
      box.
    </p>

    <h2>
      10. Would you use margin or padding to create more space between 2
      elements?
    </h2>
    <p>You would use margin to create space between two elements.</p>

    <h2>
      11. Would you use margin or padding to create more space between the
      contents of an element and its border?
    </h2>
    <p>
      You would use padding to create space between the contents of an element
      and its border.
    </p>

    <h2>
      12. Would you use margin or padding if you wanted two elements to overlap
      each other?
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you want two elements to overlap each other, you would use negative
      margin. By applying a negative margin to one or both elements, you can
      make them overlap. Padding, on the other hand, adds space between an
      element's content and its border, and would not make two elements overlap.
    </p>
    <h2>
      13. What is the difference between a block element and an inline element?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Block elements take up the full width available and create a new line
      after the element, while inline elements only take up the necessary width
      for the content and do not create a new line after the element.
    </p>

    <h2>
      14. What is the difference between an inline element and an inline-block
      element?
    </h2>
    <p>
      An inline-block element has characteristics of both a block and inline
      element. It takes up only the necessary width for the content like an
      inline element, but also allows for height and width properties to be set
      like a block element.
    </p>

    <h2>15. Is an h1 block or inline?</h2>
    <p>An h1 element is a block element.</p>

    <h2>16. Is button block or inline?</h2>
    <p>
      A button element can be either a block or inline element depending on the
      CSS styling applied.
    </p>

    <h2>17. Is div block or inline?</h2>
    <p>A div element is a block element.</p>

    <h2>18. Is span block or inline?</h2>
    <p>A span element is an inline element.</p>

    <h2>19. What’s the difference between a flex container and a flex item?</h2>
    <p>
      A flex container is an element that contains flex items and is styled with
      the display:flex property. A flex item is an element that is a direct
      child of a flex container and can be styled using flex properties such as
      flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis.
    </p>

    <h2>20. How do you create a flex item?</h2>
    <p>
      To create a flex item, simply include an element as a direct child of a
      container with the display:flex property.
    </p>

    <h2>21. What are the 3 values defined in the shorthand flex property?</h2>
    <p>
      The shorthand flex property includes the values for flex-grow,
      flex-shrink, and flex-basis. The values can be defined in the following
      format: flex: [flex-grow] [flex-shrink] [flex-basis].
    </p>

    <h2>
      22. How do you make flex items arrange themselves vertically instead of
      horizontally?
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can use the flex-direction property set to column to make flex items
      arrange themselves vertically.
    </p>

    <h2>23. What is the difference between justify-content and align-items?</h2>
    <p>
      justify-content aligns flex items horizontally, while align-items aligns
      flex items vertically.
    </p>

    <h2>
      24. How do you use flexbox to completely center a div inside a flex
      container?
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can center a div inside a flex container by setting the flex
      container's properties to display:flex, justify-content:center, and
      align-items:center.
    </p>

    <h2>
      25. What’s the difference between justify-content: space-between and
      justify-content: space-around?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The justify-content: space-between property evenly spaces flex items with
      no space at the beginning or end. The justify-content: space-around
      property evenly spaces flex items with equal space around each item,
      including space at the beginning and end.
